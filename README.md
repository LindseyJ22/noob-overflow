#### About Noob Overflow

This is a website similar to stack overflow, where a user community can post questions and have thm answered by other users. The questions and answers can be upvoted or downvoted by the community, so that the best (or at least most liked) answers rise to the top.

**Noob Overflow**'s mission is to encourage beginners to start participating right away. They are given reputation to spend right away, and the underlying philosophy of the community dictates that no one will be condescended to, and no questions are too stupid. For answering all of the repetitive questions, users are instructed to give specific help when possible, or reply with a link to one of our community _blog posts_ that can explain the underlying thought processes required to solve the problem.

#### Getting Started
Download the rails project directory, and in the terminal run bundle install, load the schema and populate it with the seed file, like so:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ rails db:schema:load
$ rails db:seed
```

Start the rails local server:

```sh
$ rails s
```

And then in your browser visit: localhost:3000.

Feel free to create an account and explore!
